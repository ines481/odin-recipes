<h2>An easy lasagna recipe that saves me a lot of time.</h2>
<p1>This recipe is simple and satisfies everyone in the family.</p1>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Meat</li>
    <li>Onion and garlic</li>
    <li>Tomato products</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Spices and seasonings</li>
    <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>Cheese</li>
    <li>Egg</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
    </li>
    <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
    </li>
    <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
    </li>
    <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!
    </li>
</ol>
