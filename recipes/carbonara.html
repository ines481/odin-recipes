<h2>An easy carbonara recipe</h2>
<p1>Getting carbonara just right can take some practice so don't despair if your carbonara sauce is a little lumpy the first time you make it.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter
    </li>
    <li>1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced
    </li>
    <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)
    </li>
    <li>3 to 4 whole eggs
    </li>
    <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese
    </li>
    <li>1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine)
    </li>
    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water.)

    </li>
    <li>While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a large saut√© pan over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy.

    </li>
    <li>In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.

    </li>
    <li>Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.

    </li>
    <li>Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water back to the pasta to keep it from drying out.

    </li>
</ol>
